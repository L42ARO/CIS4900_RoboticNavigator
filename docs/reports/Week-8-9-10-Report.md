### System Updates and Enhancements
- **Operating System Upgrade:** The ROSMASTER X3 robots initially equipped with ROS1 have been updated to a newer operating system supporting ROS2 and the latest Python versions. This update required downloading and flashing an updated OS from the manufacturer. Given the improvements, I recommend considering this upgrade for the other ROSMASTER X3 robots in the lab.

### Development of Autonomous Navigation Features
- **Wall-Following Script Implementation:** I have successfully programmed and tested a wall-following script using the robot's LIDAR and motor ROS topics. This script will serve as the foundation for automated movement necessary for conducting SLAM operations. I plan to demonstrate this functionality through a video update upon my return to town.

### Exploration of Advanced SLAM Techniques
- **OrbSLAM Exploration:** In my experiments with the depth camera, I discovered and activated a pre-existing SLAM functionality called OrbSLAM. This feature executes SLAM using point cloud data and reconstructs the robot's trajectory, showcasing an optimized approach akin to the GraphSLAM techniques. This has been a significant learning opportunity, highlighting a more advanced implementation of SLAM.

### Goals and Plans
- **Integration of Navigation and SLAM:** The immediate goal is to integrate the wall-following script with the OrbSLAM functionality. This will allow for live observation of SLAM operations, utilizing ROS2 for robust inter-program communication.
- **In-depth Study of OrbSLAM:** I aim to thoroughly study and potentially replicate the built-in OrbSLAM code to understand its mechanisms fully, which I will detail in my final report.

### Final Steps
- **Presentation and Report Submission:** I am scheduled for a demonstration and presentation on April 25 at 3:30 PM in the lab. The final report documenting all findings and methodologies will be submitted by April 26.

### Closing Remarks
Although the tasks were time-consuming, they have significantly enhanced my understanding and skills. I hope the documentation provided in my final report will be a valuable resource for future students. Thank you for your continued guidance and support throughout this project.
